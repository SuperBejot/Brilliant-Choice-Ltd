# Milestone Project 1

## Brilliant Choice Ltd web site

### Description:

This website has been created for a construction company called Brilliant Choice Ltd. The company is young and will want to attract new customers. The site is fully responsive and is a kind of portfolio, where, apart from a short description and advertising the company, the most important part is the photo gallery. In this way, the company can show off to new clients the projects it has carried out in the past, as well as the work culture. The guest also has the option of leaving his contact details if he would like to learn more about the company or talk about future cooperation. He will also find here the company address and links to social media such as Facebook or Tweeter where he will find news from the world of Brilliant Choice Ltd.

### Objectives:

- To showcase the services Brilliant Choice Ltd has to offer.
- The company will mark its place in the network.
- The company keeps up with the times and is modern.
- The company will gain new customers.
- Expansion of the company's activities on the construction market.

### Features:

- In header section we have an interactive company logo and navigation bar that helps you switch between the pages. 
- The navigation bar has a nice mechanic, where when you hover the mouse over any of the buttons, this one will be underlined, and after clicking and redirecting us to the appropriate page, the button will be constantly underlined.
- Then we have another section, which I called "main section" where there is a large picture where you can see and guess what Brilliant Choice Ltd does
- The "about us" section is nothing more than a brief description of the company and what it does.
- The footer section was devoted to links to the company's social media, where with the help of nice and large buttons we can move to the Brilliant Choice Ltd profile on Facebook or Twitter.
- On the Galleria page there are photos that the company can post in order to show off the projects it has made. This is the best way to convince the future client to establish cooperation.
- The third and last page is the Contact Us page, where I have placed a form for clients. After completing the form and leaving his contact details, the customer declares his willingness to talk to Brilliant Choice Ltd. Now all he has to do is wait up to 24 hours and someone from customer service will contact him.
- Below the form is the address and contact details of the company.
